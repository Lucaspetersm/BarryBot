  As you look at this file and read this docstring, you may be wondering to
  yourself, "Why on earth did he choose to make this file?" You might be
  thinking, "Surely, he could have just run barry/barry.py directly, which
  would save a few bytes and be a lot more straightforward." And I agree with
  you.

  The reason I made this file is because Python doesn't support relative
  imports beyond the top-level package, so you have to make everything a
  package instead and run it that way.
